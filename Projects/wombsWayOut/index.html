        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            For this project we were tasked to make a game with the theme serious humor which means it has a serious subject with a funny twist.
            Me and my group chose the subject abortion and the joke would be exaggerated features. 
            The game was a maze type 3d first person horror game meant to be played with a joystick and two buttons.
            <br> <br>
            The game has 3 enemies:
            <li>
                <span style="color: #cc983d;">[MAIN]</span> The hook <br>
                <img class="small" src="Hook.gif" alt=""> <br>
                This enemy kills you on touch
            </li>
            <li>
                Alcohol <br>
                <img class="small" src="Bot.gif" alt=""> <br>
                This enemy adds a distortion effect to your screen and inverts your inputs
            </li>
            <li>
                Cigarette <br>
                <img class="small" src="Cig.gif" alt=""> <br>
                This enemy adds a fog effect to your screen
            </li>
        </p>
        <h2>My Part</h2>
        <h3>My work</h3>
        <p>
            In this game I worked on the enemy effects this means that I wrote the code that handelt the post processing that would change depending on which enemy you got hit by. <br>
            Working in unity I also made the level and decorations for the end level and hook room. <br>
            The last part of developer work I did was making the endings and implamenting the animations. <br>
            I also worked as git master and generaly helped every member of the team with their git flow. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>My code</h3>
        <p>
            Here are some snippets of code that I wrote with some explanations underneath.
            This is some code that I made some time ago and I would have made it much better now.
            I would simply make all of this code in IEnumerators instead of the update loop.
            Then change the if statements to a while loop and start a different IEnumerator to lower the value again.
            This would make it so the code only gets run when it is needed.
            For the cigarette enemy I would do the same and check for hit in the enemy then trigger a coroutine to start the smoke effect. 
        </p>

        if (hit && currTime < time)
        {
            if (lensDistortion.intensity.value < 0.7)
            {
                lensDistortion.intensity.value += Time.deltaTime* distortSpeed;
            }
            if (aberration.intensity.value < 1)
            {
                aberration.intensity.value += Time.deltaTime * aberrationSpeed;
            }
            currTime += Time.deltaTime;
        }
        ">
        <p>
            In this script I made an if statement that checks if the bottle enemy has been hit and then changes some variable on the post processing.

            {
                lensDistortion.intensity.value -= Time.deltaTime * distortSpeed;

            }

            }
