        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of Operation Starfall is to make a multiplayer couch couch co-opin the retro 2.5D style from the 80's.
            This project started in september 2021 but I joined september 2023. This project is being made in the unity engine and mainly coded with C#.
            This project was a part of my third period om my third year on mediacollege amsterdam as an hybrid learning environment.
        </p>
        <h2>My Part</h2>
        <h3>Loot system</h3>
        <p>
            In this project I worked on the loot system and made a loot simulator.<br>
            The loot system was verly easy to edit I first made a new singelton that would do all the maths and loot dropping.<br>
            Then I made a new scriptable object that would hold the force at wich it should drop the loot so it would be easaly editable.
        </p>
        <h3>Loot simulator</h3>
        <p>
            After finishing the loot system I made a loot sim. I did so with custom editors and GUI.<br>
            In the custom edator I made a button that would activate a function in the system and roll the loot drop with the given loot table.<br>
            That I used to genarate a loot drop and put the drops in a list to make it more visual.<br>
            Than I worked on a system that would count all items with the same name and put them together to make it easier to read.<br>
            After that I made a slider that would make it possable to roll multable simulations at onece.<br>
            And lastly I made the simulation work while the game was running to also show the loot in game.<br>
            <br>
            Here is a demonstration:
