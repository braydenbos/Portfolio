        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            *Gobling* is a game developed with AI implementation, where players take on the role of a goblin running a pawn shop. Each day, different clients visit to buy and sell items, and the player can negotiate prices. The AI-driven customers remember past interactions and adjust their offers based on previous bargaining behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core mechanics include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clients offering to buy or sell items, with the player able to haggle.</li>
            <li>Clients remembering how much the player deviates from their original price, impacting future deals.</li>
            <li>Every three in-game days, the player must pay rent, which gradually increases over time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>My Part</h2>
        <p>
            I worked extensively on the client and item systems, handling various mechanics such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client data and behavior, ensuring customers have memory and dynamic pricing logic.</li>
            <li>The client manager, responsible for handling multiple customers across different in-game days.</li>
            <li>Item data and behavior, setting up the framework for different types of items in the shop.</li>
            <li>The initial implementation of the item manager.</li>
            <li>The day event manager, which tracks and updates daily shop interactions.</li>
            <li>The pawning manager, including the pawning algorithm that determines item values and transactions.</li>
            <li>Saving customer experience to ensure AI-driven interactions persist across sessions.</li>
            <li>Pixelazation, making the output of the camera more pixelated for artstyle purposes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My contributions helped shape the core gameplay loop, ensuring smooth AI interactions and an evolving player experience based on negotiation history.
