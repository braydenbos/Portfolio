        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            This was my first project in the Unity engine and I was tasked to make simple mechanics.
            The mechanics I made were movement, jumping and a melee attack. It was a school project to 
            teach me how to code in C# and use the unity game engine.
        </p>
        <h2>My Code</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I used the build in character controller in unity for movement.
            Then I apply the movement input with the camera direction to get a correct looking movement.
            For the melee attack I used a animator to make the player do an attack animation and then
            used a collider on a weapon to see if you hit an enemy.
