        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I was tasked to make a tower defense game on my own and put a original spin on it.

        </p>
        <h2>The execution</h2>
        <p>
            The first part of the game was to make a enemy movement script which I did with a waypoint system.
            Then I started to work on a tower shooting system and a enemy prediction algorithm.
            After that I made a system that chose one of the 3 maps that i made and put the waypoints on the correct spot.
            I then made a ui element where you could see how many lives you had left, turn on build mode, activate the next wave and
            place the towers in build mode.
            Next I made a money system and different enemies that had different stats and could spawn different enemies on death.
            lastly I made a win and lose screen and made the tower bullets explodable.
