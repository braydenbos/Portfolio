        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I was tasked to make a Python game about refugees trying te escape there country.
            The first thing i made was a flow chart of the story you can see the results below but they are in Dutch.
            <img src="storyPython.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;height: auto;">
            As it was my first coding project I started coding by making a lot of if statements. 
            But after finding out that that would be very hard and time consuming I found out there were functions in python.
            Using my knolage of python I made 3 inputs A B and C and that would trigger different functions.
            Then in the end I made the game loopable and added a start menu and added art to all the endings.
