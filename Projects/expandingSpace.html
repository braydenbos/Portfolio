        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I worked in a group of six people with four artists and 2 developers.
            The task of this project was to make a game that had the theme of space. We made the game 2D inside the 
            Unity game engine and used sprite sheets to animate the characters.
            As theme we chose puzzle and horror about a alien outbreak on a space ship were you have to escape.
            The alien that was chasing you for a reason it was for your energy so you can distract it by turning
            on electrical objects like generators.
        </p>
        <h2>My Part</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I made the User Interface and made a script to get animations in the UI.
            I also made all the interactabel objects and a UI element that pointed towards the next object you had to use
            if you didn't know were to go. During the whole project I also worked on helping the artist import the sprites and animations
            and then put it on GitHub. At the end of the project I also made a Line collision script and added all
            the sound in the game.
