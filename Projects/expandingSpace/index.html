        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I worked in a group of six people with four artists and 2 developers.
            The task of this project was to make a game that had the theme of space. We made the game 2D inside the 
            Unity game engine and used sprite sheets to animate the characters.
            As theme we chose puzzle and horror about a alien outbreak on a space ship were you have to escape.
            The alien that was chasing you for a reason it was for your energy so you can distract it by turning
            on electrical objects like generators.
        </p>
        <h2>My Part</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I made the User Interface and made a script to get animations in the UI.
            I also made all the interactabel objects and a UI element that pointed towards the next object you had to use
            if you didn't know were to go. During the whole project I also worked on helping the artist import the sprites and animations
            and then put it on GitHub. At the end of the project I also made a Line collision script and added all
            the sound in the game.

        <h2>Line collision</h2>
        <h3>Visualisation</h3>
        <p>
            Here is an explanation and visualisation on how my line collision script works.<br>
            I was asked to make this script and had no idea of how to make it but eventualy I managed to make it work.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is how:
        </p>
        <ul class="explanation">
            <img src="lineCollisionVisualP1.png" alt="
            When the Raycast
            from 0 to 1 hits an object before reaching 1
            it makes a new point 
            for the line renderer to draw a line">
            <img src="lineCollisionVisualP2.png" alt="
            If the line renderer 
                has more than 1 point 
            it will make a new raycast from 0 to 2">
        </ul>
        <ul class="explanation">
            <img src="lineCollisionVisualP3.png" alt="
            If the raycast from 0 to 2 reaches 2 without hitting another object 
            it will delete point 1 
            and lower all other points by 1">
            <img src="lineCollisionVisualP4.png" alt="
            In this senario 
            there would be no new points added 
            and point 1 would be deleted 
            making point 2 point 1 
            removing the second raycast">
        </ul>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
            Here is the code I used:
        </p>
        <img style="height: auto;" src="LineCollisionEnter.png" alt="block of code saying
        private void DetectCollisionEnter()
        {
            RaycastHit hit;
            if (Physics.Linecast(to.position, rope.GetPosition(ropePositions.Count - 2), out hit, collMask))
            {
                if (rope.GetPosition(ropePositions.Count - 2) != hit.point)
                {
                    ropePositions.RemoveAt(ropePositions.Count - 1);
                    AddPosToRope(hit.point);
                }
            }
        }">
        <p>
            This block of code is how the line detects if it does collide and makes a new point on that possition.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img style="height: auto;" src="LineCollisionExit.png" alt="block of code saying
        private void DetectCollisionExits()
        {
            RaycastHit hit;
            if (!Physics.Linecast(to.position, rope.GetPosition(ropePositions.Count - 3), out hit, collMask))
            {
                ropePositions.RemoveAt(ropePositions.Count - 2);
            }
        }">
        <p>
            This block of code is how the line detects if the previous point is no longer colliding and if not it will delete the point.
