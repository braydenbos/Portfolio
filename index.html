                Game programmer/Character and Creature designer
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Hi there! I'm a character and creature designer/programmer, 
                and I would like to show you what I can do. 
                My portfolio has lots of different characters and creatures that I've created for different types of projects. 
                I'm always eager to learn especially about things I'm not familiar with, 
                and I'm excited to work on future project to create cool characters and creatures.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm also a game developer with experience in programming languages like C# and C++, 
                as well as game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. 
                I specialize in using C# to develop gameplay mechanics and user interfaces.
                I also love to solve problems and love to see my code working in the way that I want to,
                even if I don't fully understand it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you for looking at my portfolio and I hope you are impressed or at least interested.
            </p>

                        In my free time I like to do many things like game and watch a show or movie but I also like to hang out with my friends and spent time with my familie.
                        I also like to code in my free time and enjoy making small games to learn new things I also like learning new things in general.
                        With a couple of friends I also play dungeons and dragons where I express my creativatiy.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through out my live I've wanted to be many things like astronaut, veterinary and engineer but when I was around 14 I knew I wanted to make something fun
                        That I personaly would play so I took some coding classes and immediately realised that I was good at it.
                        When it was time to choose what school I wanted to go to studing game development was my first choice and I don't regret that dessision one bit.
